\section{Preface}
This is L2 Stars and Galaxies. If you've done introduction to astronomy in L1, it will certainly help your understanding of many concepts discussed in the lectures. However, you will fine if you haven't done this course. \par Physics as problem solving is used a lot in this course. Many derived equations and models for processes begin with a few assumptions and approximations. Perhaps because we cannot recreate some environments in the lab.... However, it is still reassuring to know that physics \textit{works} even when simple models are created. In the context of astronomy, when we make observations and measurements of the night sky, we might have to adjust our model based on what we see and even completley rework from the ground up.
