\section*{Introduction}

These notes are designed to summarise the Foundations of Physics 2A (PHYS2581) Quantum Mechanics course, as taught by Prof. S Cole in the 2018/19 academic year. 

\section*{Summary}

\subsection*{The Five Postulates of Quantum Mechanics}

The content in this course can be summarised with the following five postulates:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item All possible predictions of the physical properties of a dynamical system can be obtained via its wavefunction.
	\item Every dynamical variable can be represented by a Hermitian operator, whose eigenvalues give the possible values of measurement of the dynamical variable. 
	\item The operators representing position and momentum are $x$ and $-i\hbar\nabla$ respectively. Operators for other dymanical variables can be derived using their corresponding dynaimcal variables' classical relations to position and momentum. 
	\item The probability of measuring a particular result of a superposition of states is given by the probability amplitude of the relevant eigenfunction, squared. 
	\item The time evolution of the wavefunction is described by the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation.
\end{enumerate}
