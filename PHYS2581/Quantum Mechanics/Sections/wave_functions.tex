\subsection{Dirac Notation}

In Dirac notation, devised by Paul Dirac, bra and ket vectors are used to represent wave functions and their complex conjugates:

\[ \text{(ket):\;} \ket{\Psi} = \Psi; \; \text{(bra):\;} \bra{\Psi} = \Psi^*; \]

They can be used together to represent the expectation of an operator $\hat{Q}$:

\[ \expval{\hat{Q}}{\Psi} = \int_{V} \Psi^*\hat{Q}\Psi dV \]
