\section{Preface}
Welcome to MathMeth in 2nd year. If you remember 1st year maths thats great. A lot of the first lectures are material covered last year with a tiny bit more formality and rigour (that is if you did SMA and SMB). If you opted for Math Department modules in first years then huzzah! You'll get used to the very applicational approach of the maths run by the physics department, which is not to say, a bad thing. A lot of new topics are covered which is great! It'll begin to feel as if you're really doing a physics degree if you haven't already felt that from your other courses, or even from 1st year....

Due to the nature of the course, the excercises are 'problem based' with 'thinking' questions put in where they can. Much of the understanding comes from the motivation and use of the things you're learning so make sure you understand them before jumping in to an exercise. - St. Aidan's PhysSoc
