\section{Preface}
This course is one of the harder aspects of L2 Physics. Harder in the sense that the reader will more than likely be lost in some derivations or explanations of what some of the content means. \par
These notes are meant as a further addition to the lectures and notes provided by the lecturer. You will get the most out of these notes if you know what it is they're talking about.
